            During the period 2005 to 2021, Aboriginal children and young people constituted 4.5% of the South Australian population of children and young people, but they accounted for 12% of child deaths. The rate of death for all Aboriginal children and young people who died in South Australia was 80 deaths per 100,000. For Aboriginal children and young people who were usually resident in South Australia, the death rate was 65 deaths per 100,000 over the same period (Figure 1).
        </p>
        <p>
            This difference in rates reflects the number of children and young people with complex medical conditions who were retrieved from other states or territories for treatment in South Australian hospitals. The rate of death for non-Aboriginal children and young people was 28 deaths per 100,000. The rate of death for non-Aboriginal children and young people usually resident in South Australia was 27 deaths per 100,000.
        </p>
        <p>
            Figure 2 shows the death rate for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children and young people in each Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage quintile. The death rate for Aboriginal children and young people is significantly greater than for their non-Aboriginal peers, regardless of the level of socioeconomic disadvantage they experience. Note that the death rate for Aboriginal children and young people in the least disadvantaged areas has not been calculated because fewer than three deaths were recorded.
